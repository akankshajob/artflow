# 🎨 Art Gallery Management System

The **Art Gallery Management System (ArtFlow)** is a comprehensive web-based application designed to transform and automate the operations of an art gallery. It provides a modern and efficient platform for managing artwork inventory, exhibitions, artist relations, and customer interactions.

## 🎯 Features

## 🧠 Motivation

Traditional gallery systems rely on paperwork, manual registers, and disconnected processes. This results in:
